Goal:
	Investigate relationship between [light output & noise] and [gate & capacitor voltage]
	Similar to 2019-10-13 testing, but with an entire bank of LED's (3x LED's)
	Potentially desctructive test budget: 3 LED

Equipment:Â 
	NQTRONIX Active Probe
	BK Precision Oscilloscope
	55-cm integrating sphere
	Digital multimeter
	Rev. 3 controller prototype with MIC2171-based flyback converter
	
Setup:
	Single LED strobing for 1 microsecond at various capacitor voltages (65 - 150 V) and MOSFET gate voltages (7 - 16 V)
	Oscilloscope channel 1 is connected to the active light probe
	Oscilloscope channel 2 is connected to the capacitor voltage (to measure voltage drop, allowing cacluclation of average current)
	
Results:
	TO BE COMPLETED
	
Comments:
	Stopped at 90 volts as light probe was clipping (2.1 volts)
	Need to build an ND filter mount for the integrating sphere
	No LED's damaged
