# high_speed_flash
This is the data repository for my microsecond strobe designs.  They are high-speed flashes used for photographing bullets or other projectiles or processes.  The entire project is open-source.

## MK1 - The Edgerton

The original strobe was designed to be simple to assemble and as affordable as possible.  Photographers, please be aware that some soldering skills are required.

## MK2 - The E2 Series

These are called a series because multiple submodels are planned.  Currently only the E2-A is complete.

The E2 series are very similar to the MK1 Edgerton, but have been designed with commercial production in mind.  You can build one yourself, but some more complicated processes are involved.  Additionally, the total cost is slightly higher.  The advantage is that the E2 series is smaller, more robust, and easier to use.

### Planned E2 Submodels:

E2-A | E2-K | E2-V
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Standard | High-powered 1-microsecond | Videographer
**Plans & specs available** | In development | In development
 |  | **120+ Watt Constant illumination mode**
Battery only | Battery only | Battery OR external power supply
**0.5 - 4 microsecond strobe** | 0.5 - 1 microsecond strobe | **0.5 - 4 microsecond strobe**
Standard LED Power | **Increased LED Power** | Standard LED Power
**Well-Established Safety Margin** | LED's more likely to fail | **Well-Established Safety Margin**

## Comparison

MK1 Edgerton | MK2 E2-A
------------ | -------------
**Affordable** | About 30% more expensive
**Relatively simple to assemble** (3D printer, soldering skills, Through-Hole Components) | Slightly more difficult (Aluminum milling / drilling, better cable management required, Surface-Mount Components)
Reliable | **Reliable PLUS**
8x AA batteries | **4x AA batteries**
Battery compartment difficult to access | **Easy to use battery compartment**
Cheap display | **Attractive, intuitive display**
Larger | **Smaller**
Single strobes only | **Multi-strobe capable**

## Research & Testing
The most valuable part of this project is the research and testing.  Many LED's have been destructively tested to find their limitations.  I plan to upload all of my testing data to this repository and encourage others to share any testing performed as well.
