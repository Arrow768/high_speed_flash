# high_speed_flash
Edgerton is a high-speed flash used for photographing bullets or other projectiles.  The project is open-source.  Please see https://hackaday.io/project/165622-edgerton-a-high-speed-led-flash for more information.

## Building Your Flash
Please download and follow the Assembly Manual.  This detailed manual should answer most of your questions.

The main control board can be built in several ways.  You may build it using a blank perfboard PCB (See the perfboard layout), by etching and drilling your own PCB (See the Gerber files), or by purchasing a control board from me (https://www.tindie.com/products/19592/).

The firmware has been tested and will make setup quick and easy.  Please flash it to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.  Before turning on your flash, please review the User's Manual.

## Research & Testing
The most valuable part of this project is the research and testing.  Many LED's have been destructively tested to find their limitations.  I plan to upload all of my testing data to this repository and encourage others to share any testing performed as well.
