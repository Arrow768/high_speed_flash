Goal:
	Investigate relationship between [light output & noise] and [gate & capacitor voltage]
	Potentially desctructive test budget: 1 LED

Equipment: 
	NQTRONIX Active Probe
	BK Precision Oscilloscope
	55-cm integrating sphere
	Digital multimeter
	Rev. 3 controller prototype with MIC2171-based flyback converter
	
Setup:
	Single LED strobing for 1 microsecond at various capacitor voltages (65 - 150 V) and MOSFET gate voltages (7 - 16 V)
	Oscilloscope channel 1 is connected to the active light probe
	Oscilloscope channel 2 is connected to the capacitor voltage (to measure voltage drop, allowing cacluclation of average current)
	10uF capacitor
	
Results:
	Light output -v- capacitor voltage relationship remains relatively linear between 65 V and 150 V.  There is no significant drop-off
	Gate voltage between 8 V and 16 V does not have significant effect on light output
	Gate voltage does have significant effect on light output noise, especially during turn-on.  Turn-on noise can be eliminated and turn-off noise can be reduced by lowering gate voltage.
	Gate voltage below 8 V has significant detrimental effect on light output.
	LED was not damaged during tests
	
Comments:
	The new Rev. 3 prototype controller is almost identical to the Rev. 2, except that the layout is much easier to manage.
	By coincidence, the 8 - 12 V gate voltage used by the original flash design appears to be ideal.  The Mark 2 will have a regulated gate voltage and it will likely be set somewhere in that neighbourhood.
	The 125 V capacitor voltage limit may be revisited as higher voltages appear to greatly enhance the light output.
	This test is limited by the fact that only one LED was used.  The next experiment will be identical, but with a complete bank of 3x LED's.
