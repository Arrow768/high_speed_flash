Goal:
	QA testing of five different EMCB0 rev1.2c boards
	These traces were acquired during the QA process

Equipment: 
	Siglent SDS1202X-E Oscilloscope
	EMCB0 rev1.2c Control boards x5
	
Setup:
	1us - 1 Microsecond pulse, Ch1 = Gate Driver Output, Ch2 = Microcontroller Output
	2us - 2 Microsecond pulse, Ch1 = Gate Driver Output, Ch2 = Microcontroller Output
	4us - 4 Microsecond pulse, Ch1 = Gate Driver Output, Ch2 = Microcontroller Output
	500ns - 0.5 Microsecond pulse, Ch1 = Gate Driver Output, Ch2 = Microcontroller Output
	HighPassFilterTest - 1,000 Microsecond pulse from microcontroller using modified firmware to test high-pass filter (limits pulses to 5 microseconds), Ch1 = Gate Driver Output, Ch2 = Microcontroller Output
	TriggerActiveHigh - Push-button attached to trigger input to test delay between trigger input going HIGH and flash output, CH1 = Trigger Input, Ch2 = Gate Driver Output
	TriggerActiveHigh - Push-button attached to trigger input to test delay between trigger input going LOW and flash output, CH1 = Trigger Input, Ch2 = Gate Driver Output
	
Results:
	High-pass filter varies from unit - unit between 4.5 - 5.0 microseconds
	Pulse durations are within 250 ns of described duration
	Both active-low and active-high trigger response times are 2 microseconds or less
	
Comments:
	Results are satisfactory
	8MHz clock rate is sufficient for this purpose
	Active-high triggering has improved significantly since 2019-11-21 tests due to circuitry improvements
