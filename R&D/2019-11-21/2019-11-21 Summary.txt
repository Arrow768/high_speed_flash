Goal:
	Test high-pass filter
	Test trigger reponse time for RISING and FALLING signals

Equipment: 
	BK Precision Oscilloscope
	Control boards x2 (S/N 002 & 003)
	
Setup:
	Upload modified firmware (4uS pulse will trigger gate for 1,000 uS)
	Connect scope channel 1 to Gate output, channel 2 to Trigger input
	Arm scope
	Perform 2x falling edge triggers by closing switch between trigger input and ground
		(microcontroller set to 1,000uS pulse output in order to test high-pass filter)
	Perform 2x rising edge triggers by opening switch between trigger input and ground
		(microcontroller set to 1,000uS pulse output in order to test high-pass filter)
	
Results:
	Falling-edge trigger delay is about 1 microsecond
	Rising-edge trigger delay is <20 microseconds
	High-pass filter is well-tuned, about 4.5 uS
	
Comments:
	Results are satisfactory
	Falling-edge triggers are preferred, perhaps look into improvements to rising edge triggering
